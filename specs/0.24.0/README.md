### Events

Events represent a change in state of a subscriber. They are used to trigger workflows, and enable you to send
notifications to subscribers based on their actions.

### Subscribers

A subscriber in Novu represents someone who should receive a message. A subscriberâ€™s profile information contains
important attributes about the subscriber that will be used in messages (name, email). The subscriber object can contain
other key-value pairs that can be used to further personalize your messages.

### Topics

Topics are a way to group subscribers together so that they can be notified of events at once. A topic is identified by
a custom key. This can be helpful for things like sending out marketing emails or notifying users of new features.
Topics can also be used to send notifications to the subscribers who have been grouped together based on their
interests, location, activities and much more.

### Layouts

Novu allows the creation of layouts - a specific HTML design or structure to wrap content of email notifications.
Layouts can be manipulated and assigned to new or existing workflows within the Novu platform, allowing users to create,
manage, and assign these layouts to workflows, so they can be reused to structure the appearance of notifications sent
through the platform.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                       | Description        | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Workflows

All notifications are sent via a workflow. Each workflow acts as a container for the logic and blueprint that are
associated with a type of notification in your system.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                          | Description            | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Notification Templates

Deprecated. Use Workflows (/workflows) instead, which provide the same functionality under a new name.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                                       | Description            | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Changes

Changes represent a change in state of an environment. They are analagous to a pending pull request in git, enabling you
to test changes before they are applied to your environment and atomically apply them when you are ready.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                     | Description       | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes                 |

### Environments

Novu uses the concept of environments to ensure logical separation of your data and configuration. This means that
subscribers, and preferences created in one environment are never accessible to another.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                             | Description             | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Inbound Parse

Inbound Webhook is a feature that allows processing of incoming emails for a domain or subdomain. The feature parses the
contents of the email and POSTs the information to a specified URL in a multipart/form-data format.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                    | Description                                                      | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Feeds

Novu provides a notification activity feed that monitors every outgoing message associated with its relevant metadata.
This can be used to monitor activity and discover potential issues with a specific provider or a channel type.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint           | Description | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Tenants

A tenant represents a group of users. As a developer, when your apps have organizations, they are referred to as
tenants. Tenants in Novu provides the ability to tailor specific notification experiences to users of different groups
or organizations.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                 | Description   | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Messages

A message in Novu represents a notification delivered to a recipient on a particular channel. Messages contain
information about the request that triggered its delivery, a view of the data sent to the recipient, and a timeline of
its lifecycle events. Learn more about messages.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                                 | Description                      | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Organizations

An organization serves as a separate entity within your Novu account. Each organization you create has its own separate
integration store, workflows, subscribers, and API keys. This separation of resources allows you to manage multi-tenant
environments and separate domains within a single account.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                                   | Description                                      | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |
